# Programming Assignments

This repository contains solutions to a series of programming assignments, primarily focusing on concepts in machine learning and data analysis.

## Assignment 1

This assignment includes:

*   `file_stats.py`: A script that reads a file containing numbers and calculates the mean and standard deviation for each column.
*   `nth_smallest.py`: A script that finds the nth smallest number within a specified sub-array of a NumPy array.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 2

This assignment includes:

*   `naive_bayes.py`: A script that implements the Naive Bayes classification algorithm.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 3

This assignment includes:

*   `linear_regression.py`: A script that implements linear regression.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 4

This assignment includes:

*   `nn_keras.py`: A script that implements a neural network using the Keras library. It also appears there is an `nn_keras_opt.py` which might be an optimized version or related experiment.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 5

This assignment includes:

*   `decision_tree.py`: A script that implements a decision tree classifier.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 6

This assignment includes:

*   `k_means.py`: A script that implements the K-Means clustering algorithm.
*   `knn_classify.py`: A script that likely implements K-Nearest Neighbors classification (based on the name).
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## Assignment 7

This assignment includes:

*   `value_iteration.py`: A script that implements the value iteration algorithm, likely for solving a Markov Decision Process.
*   `answers.pdf`: A document containing answers related to this assignment.

## General Notes

*   The Python scripts in these assignments likely require Python 3.
*   Commonly used libraries include NumPy. Some assignments may also require TensorFlow (with Keras) and Scikit-learn.
*   It is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install dependencies as needed for each assignment, for example:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
    ```
